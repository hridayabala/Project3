                <h3>Skin Cancer</h3>
                <p>
                    Skin cancer is the one of the most common cancers in the United States. 
                    To lower your skin cancer risk, protect your skin from 
                    the sun and avoid indoor tanning. The survival rate of a person with skin 
                    cancer depends on their age and their access to care and treatment.

                    Breast cancer is the most common cancer around the world. 
                    It is normally found to be diagnosed in older women. 
                    Some ways to prevent breast cancer is by keeping a healthy weight, 
                    being physically active, and either choosing not to drink alcohol, 
                    or drinking it in moderation.

                <p>
                    Lung cancer is a common type of cancer, that can be cured if found in its early stages.
                    It is mostly caused by smoking, secondhand smoke, or exposure to chemcicals and toxins.
                    Symptoms include cough, chest pain, wheezing, and weight loss, but they 
                    don't appear until the cancer is advanced.

                <h3>Bone Cancer</h3>
                <p>
                    Bone cancer can begin in any bone in the body, but it most commonly affects the pelvis 
                    or the long bones in the arms and legs. A bone tumor may cause a painless mass. Some 
                    people have dull, aching pain. And in some cases, minor injury causes a fracture near 
                    the tumor. Bone cancer is rare, making up less than 1 percent of all cancers.

                <p>
                    Leukemia is a broad term for cancers of the blood cells. The type of leukemia depends on 
                    the type of blood cell that becomes cancer and whether it grows quickly or slowly. 
                    Leukemia occurs most often in adults older than 55, but it is also the most common cancer 
                    in children younger than 15.

                    Pancreatic cancer begins in the tissues of your pancreas — an organ in your abdomen that 
                    lies behind the lower part of your stomach. This type of cancer is often detected late, 
                    spreads rapidly, and has a poor prognosis. There are no symptoms in the early stages. This 
                    type of cancer is often detected late, spreads rapidly, and has a poor prognosis.

                <p>
                    Gastric cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lining of the 
                    stomach. Age, diet, and stomach disease can affect the risk of developing gastric cancer. 
                    Symptoms of gastric cancer include indigestion and stomach discomfort or pain.

                    Kidney cancer develops when cells in your kidneys change and grow out of control. People 
                    with kidney cancer may notice flank pain, high blood pressure, blood in their pee and 
                    other symptoms. Kidney cancer treatments include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
